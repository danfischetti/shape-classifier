# shape-classifier
Classifies 3D meshes taken from the princeton shape benchmark

## Description

This projects consists of 2 parts. 

1) A jsonrpc server running inside a blender process allowing remote calls for actions like moving the camera and rendering to files.

2) A neural network based on Deepmind's recent work with recurrent attention.[1][2] The network learns how to classify a 3D shape given a few renders of that shape and learns a policy for moving the camera to get the best views for classifying.
